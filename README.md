# Inductor Resistor Capacitor Circuit Simulation
- Developed a program that simulates how current changes over time in an inductor-resistor-capacitor circuit with
AC and DC battery options
- Coded different solutions of the associated differential equation to produce accurate simulations depending on the
user-set initial conditions
- Collaborated with my mathematics professor for feedback and suggested features
